# BCB-X3DH

Blockchain based implementation of X3DH protocol [1]. 

Based on [2].

Report is written in LaTeX and located at [3], but i won't probably open it to the public,
so there is a compiled pdf version in this repo. 

In Makefile there are alice and bob sides, hardhat node, and also Ethernal explorer [4].
